Diwali is celebrated with joy all over India.
The PMO seems to be very active on social media platforms. Education should be free for everyone. Superheroes are boring. Tab key is important. Potatoes are a rich source of Vitamin C. The BARC stands for Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. She sings like an angel. I am a coder, normal life is boring for me.
Bats and rats are quick. Ranchi is the capital of Jharkhand state. Don't forget your wallet. Let us see how many of you will guess the answer correctly. College is irrelevant these days. The UNIX started it all. Bats and rats are quick. There are seven continets in the world.
Dust was all over the place. Give me a break. I shall count the number of sentences now. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Bill Gates is ultra rich. Follow traffic rules. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. None of us is as smart as all of us.
There are seven continets in the world. Make India great again. This sweet is tasty. Let's just hope there will no World War Three. I love Exam Cluster. Computers have truly revolutionized the world. The time is always right, do not wait. Astronauts are wonderful.
Time travel is a wonderful concept. NEET is not everyone's cup of tea. Tab key is important. None of us is as smart as all of us. The moon is remarkably close to the Earth. Bill Gates is ultra rich. The British made sure they looted all that they could from us. Every morning brings out a new opportunity in the form of a new day.
All the doors and windows of that house were open. No one buys sixty watermellons. Give me fifteen oranges. Help me find that girl. I hate going to banks these days. There are seven continets in the world. Trucks connect the world. Make sure you spell that word right.
Vegetarians are quietly saving the world.
